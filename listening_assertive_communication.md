### How can you make your communication assertive? You can watch and analyse the videos, then think what would be a few steps you can apply in your own life? (Watch the videos first before answering this question.)

I can make my communication asssertive by applyind those 5 tips shared in the video:
* Recognize and name your feeling correctly
* Recognize what acctually our needs are
* Start with someone with whome you are very friendly
* Your body language and your words should not conflict with each other
* Don't wait that the person will understand your feelings, just say right there in the moment.

Besides these I can be honest about my feelings and needs with everyone, like for example in office if someone takes my chair while I am away i can directly approach that person asking them to return the chair and get one from any other room.
