# Tiny Habits


## Question 1

### In this video(by BJ Fogg), what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

Habits are not build over night, we have to be regular if we want to build any habit. Look into your life, find what you want to change, break them down into tiny parts, and put them in the right place. Always have a small celebration for your tiny achievements.

## Question 2

### How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.

**B = MAP** stands for Behaviour is equal to the level of motivation plus ability to do that plus trigger/prompt that reminds you for doing that.

We should start with habits that takes low level of motivation and are easy to do and gradually increase as we go to build a habit out of it.


## Question 3

### Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)

Shine is the feeling that you get after successfully completing a task. The more we celebrate, the faster we develop that habit. When we celebrate after any small success our motivation level and confidece both rises quickly, this means that what it matters is the frequency of success and not the size of success.
