# Prevention of Sexual Harassment


### What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?

Sexual harassment can be categorized as;
1. **QUID PRO QUO**
 
This category includes the harassment by higher officials such as supervisors, managers etc.
* Asking for sexual favours in return of something i.e. promotions, help at work etc
* Threatening them if the don't agree to your demands

2. **HOSTILE WORK ENVIRONMENT**

This category mainly include the harassment and behaviour of your co-workers/colleagues, people around you in the office.  
* Cracking vulgar jokes in the office.
* Inappropriate touching/rubbing.
* Constant stairing.
* Repeatedly asking for something despite being denied earlier.
* Passing comments of physical appearance / dress.
* Visually harassing through posters, screensavers.


### What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?

* Firstly I would try to talk directly to the person and ask him/her to refrain themself from doing it again as it makes me uncomfortable.

* If they continue then I would document everything as much as possible including date, time, location, description of event, names involved and report it to the HR department immediately so they can take appropriate action against the offender.

* If possible take a photo and send it along with report.

* If reporting is not possible, then I would discuss it with a trusted person like manager, supervisor and seek support from friends, family members, colleagues who are also victims of this kind of behavior, who can help me take appropriate action and prevent further such incidents.
