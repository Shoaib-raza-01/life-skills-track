# Learning Process 1 
### What is the Feynman Technique? Explain in 1 line.

Feynman Technique is a effective way of learning something which simply says that **"if you can't explain something to someone without stucking, you  didn't learned well"**


### In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

In this video the most interesting idea was "Not just follow your passion but broaden your passion" and the idea of learning by the method of active/focus and diffused mode of thinking. Her backstory was also interesting that how she kept on trying new things and landed in different locations experiencing new culture and building new perspective of seeing things.


### What are active and diffused modes of thinking?


Active and Diffused are the two different approachs of thinking about any problem statement or while making any decision. 

The active mode of thinking is categorized as a process where high level of mental focus and concentration is required. We have to pick the problem statement and think about it with full concentration to generate any solution based on our existing knowledge and experience. 

The diffused mode of thoinking is a relaxed and non-directed approach of thinking about any problem or decision. Here the persone needs to make themselves comfortable and let their minds to explore any spontaneous, unstructured idea. Then this unstructured idea is taken to the focused/active mode to finally come up with a solution.



### According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic? Only mention the points.

* Deconstruct the skill
    * Decide what exactly you will do with that skill.
    * Breake the skill into smaller pieces.
    * Practice the most important thing first.
    <!-- * Use SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) -->
* Learn enough to self-correct or self-practice
* Remove practice barriers *(eg. phone, social media, tv, games)*
* Practice for 20 hours.
* To learn something have the necessary tool.

### What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?

- Apply the Feynman Technique combined with the 20 hour rule by Josh Kaufman for effectivly learning the new concepts.
- Take breaks from time to time.
- Try to understand why it is important and where it is used.
- Try different ways of doing things.
- Don't compare yourself to others.
- Focus on one task at a time.
- Practice more and more atleast three times (written/verbally).
