# Learning Process 1

## In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

In this video the most interesting idea was "Not just follow your passion but broaden your passion" and the idea of learning by the method of active/focus and diffused mode of thinking. Her backstory was also interesting that how she kept on trying new things and landed in different locations experiencing new culture and building new perspective of seeing things.


## What are active and diffused modes of thinking?


Active and Diffused are the two different approachs of thinking about any problem statement or while making any decision. 

The active mode of thinking is categorized as a process where high level of mental focus and concentration is required. We have to pick the problem statement and think about it with full concentration to generate any solution based on our existing knowledge and experience. 

The diffused mode of thoinking is a relaxed and non-directed approach of thinking about any problem or decision. Here the persone needs to make themselves comfortable and let their minds to explore any spontaneous, unstructured idea. Then this unstructured idea is taken to the focused/active mode to finally come up with a solution.

## How can you make your communication assertive? You can watch and analyse the videos, then think what would be a few steps you can apply in your own life? (Watch the videos first before answering this question.)

I can make my communication asssertive by applyind those 5 tips shared in the video:
* Recognize and name your feeling correctly
* Recognize what acctually our needs are
* Start with someone with whome you are very friendly
